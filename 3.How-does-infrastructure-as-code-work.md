# How does infrastructure as code work

Much like software code describes an application and how it works, infrastructure as code (IaC) describes a system architecture and how it works.
An infrastructure architecture contains resources such as servers, networking, operating systems, and storage. IaC controls virtualized resources
by treating configuration files like source code files. You can use it to manage infrastructure in a codified, repeatable way.

IaC configuration management tools use different language specifications. You can develop IaC similar to application code in Python or Java.
You also write the IaC in an integrated development environment (IDE) with built-in error checking.
And you can maintain it under source control with commits at each code change. IaC files are included as part of the wider codebase.

## Approaches to IaC

There are two different approaches to infrastructure as code.

### Declarative

Declarative IaC allows a developer to describe resources and settings that make up the end state of a desired system.
The IaC solution then creates this system from the infrastructure code. This makes declarative IaC simple to use,
as long as the developer knows which components and settings they need to run their application.

### Imperative

Imperative IaC allows a developer to describe all the steps to set up the resources and get to the desired system and running state.
While it isnâ€™t as simple to write imperative IaC as declarative IaC, the imperative approach becomes necessary in complex infrastructure deployments.
This is especially true when the order of events is critical.
